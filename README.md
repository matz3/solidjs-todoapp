# solidjs-todoapp

This project uses solid [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) together with [Fundamental Library Styles](https://fundamental-styles.netlify.app/) and [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/) to implement a todo application from scratch. Both libraries are a perfect symbiosis and helps you to quickly create an application following the [SAP Fiori Design](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/).

## Usage

The project is using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). To get started ensure that pnpm is installed globally on your machine via `npm i -g pnpm`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `pnpm serve`

Runs the app in the productive mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) to view it in the browser.

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
